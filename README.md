# Breast_Cancer_Detection_Logistic_Regression_Project

This repository presents a machine learning project focused on early breast cancer detection using logistic regression. The project leverages a comprehensive dataset to train and evaluate a predictive model capable of classifying instances as benign or malignant.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Thorough data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for modeling.

Logistic Regression: Implementation of a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of breast cancer based on input features.

Model Evaluation: Rigorous evaluation of the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Visualization: Clear and informative visualizations to illustrate the model's behavior and decision-making process.

Technologies:

Python 

Pandas

Matplotlib

Scikit-Learn

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook 

Usage:

Clone the repository: git clone <repository_url>

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script: Execute the provided code to train the model, evaluate its performance, and visualize the results.

Potential Improvements:

Feature Selection: Explore feature selection techniques to identify the most informative features for the model.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the logistic regression model's hyperparameters to enhance performance.

Ensemble Methods: Consider combining logistic regression with other machine learning algorithms to improve accuracy.

Deployment: Deploy the trained model as a web application or API for real-time predictions.
